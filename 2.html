        <a href="www.naver.com" target="_blank" title="네이버">This</a> is a
      rather unusual glossary in that all of the words on the list
      are essentially synonymous - they are nouns meaning nonsense, gibberish,
      claptrap, hogwash, rubbish ... <strong><u>you</u></strong> get the idea. It probably shouldn't be
      surprising that this category is so productive of weird words.
      After all, what better way to disparage someone's ideas than to combine
      some nonsense syllables to make a descriptor for them? You more or less
      always can identify their meaning from context alone -

      <p>
      either they're used as interjections, preceded by words like .
      'such' or 'unadulterated' or 'ridiculous'. But which to choose?
      You have the reduplicated ones (fiddle-faddle),
      the pseudo-classical (brimborion), the ones that literally mean something
      repulsive (spinach), and of course the wide variety that are euphemisms
      for bodily functions. Excluded from this list are the wide variety of
      very fun terms that are simple vulgarities without any
      specific reference to nonsense.
